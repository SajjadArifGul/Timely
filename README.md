# Timely
Timely is a simple time tracking application I developed to help me keep track of my time I spend on different projects.

There are 2 simple options in this application.
<ol>
<li>Tasks</li>
<li>Task Events</li>
</ol>

<h4>1. Tasks</h4>
<p>As the name suggest, tasks are something I want to keep track of. Task can be anything, developing projects, attempting tests, playing games, watching movies. Simply add a name for task in Timely and hit 'add task icon', it will be added in Tasks list.</p>

<h4>2. Task Events</h4>
<p>
A task event is simply an event of when you did this task. When an event is created, its status is marked as 'Started' and Timely starts its tracking time. This event is displayed in the History list. If you double click any started event, a detailed popup will appear with a detailed timer to show how much time is spent on this event. You can place this popup anywhere on your desktop screen for easy lookup. You can also stop this event by clicking on 'Stop Event icon'. A task can have any number of events. Total Duration will display the total amount of time that has been spent doing this task by summing time of all the task events.
